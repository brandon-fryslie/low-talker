## lit Agent-Native Workflow

This repository uses `lit` for agent-native issue tracking.

Start by running `lit quickstart` to load the workflow instructions. It prints how tickets are found, created, updated, and closed here, so running it first means the rest of your work follows the conventions this repo expects. It's a quick, read-only command — no need to check in before running it.

## Logging out or restarting is never a requirement

No change, install, upgrade, or verification may require logging out and back in, or restarting — on this Mac, on a test Mac, or on a user's Mac. Never ask for one, never write one into a handoff, ticket, doc, or installer, and never count on one that happens anyway.

Done correctly, nothing here needs one. If a step seems to need a logout, we have broken a macOS rule: entitlements, input method registration or placement, or Info.plist / package manifest configuration. Fix that violation. A check that only passes after a logout or restart has failed.

## The input method follows the IMK guidelines

Brandon adopted vChewing's "macOS Input Method Development Guidelines for 2026" on 2026-09-29. They bind every change to code the input method process runs (`Sources/lowtalker-inputmethod` and the libraries it links: `InputMethod`, `Insertion`, `Flavors`) and to the input method targets in `project.yml`:

1. **Connection name.** `InputMethodConnectionName` is the input method's bundle identifier plus `_Connection`, and no other string. `Flavor.inputMethodConnectionName` derives it.
2. **Always sandboxed.** The sandbox is what stops a process that is handed the keyboard from reaching anything else. Each entitlement must name the failure that needed it. The guide's sample list (network client, user-selected files, bookmarks) belongs to vChewing, which uses those things. Copying it here grants access nothing uses. If the input method ever reads its own `UserDefaults` and the sandbox refuses the read, the guide's fix is the `shared-preference.read-only` and preferences-plist exceptions for its own identifier.
3. **Main actor.** Every `IMKInputController` callback and every call on its client runs on the main actor. The overrides are `nonisolated` and move their arguments onto the main actor through one hop: inline when already on the main thread, `DispatchQueue.main.sync` otherwise. Everything else defaults to main-actor isolation.
4. **Client calls.** Any client call may be dispatched async onto the main actor, except `insertText` and `setMarkedText`, which run on it synchronously. No client call runs on another thread.
5. **Controller lifetime.** IMKServer orphans one controller per Caps Lock toggle, and the client connection it holds leaks with it. The input method has to prune those controllers and tear down their connections itself.
6. **Logic lives in libraries.** A breakpoint in a running input method freezes every app that has touched it, and then the desktop. Never attach a debugger to it. Put behavior in the `InputMethod` library, test it there against mock clients, and read the running process through the unified log.
7. **Memory ceiling.** At each `activateServer` the input method reads its own footprint. Over 1024 MB it tells the person and exits.
8. **No windows.** Every NSWindow costs memory macOS 26 never reclaims. The input method has none. If it ever needs one, one NSPanel serves every purpose.
9. **No IMKCandidates.**

The code does not yet follow 3, 4, 5 and 7. Epic `low-imk-rules-w3g` holds one ticket for each, and the ticket that brings a rule into line deletes its number from that list. Until then, treat the code that breaks a rule as an exception to fix. Do not copy it as precedent. The trap is rule 4. `Committer` commits off the main thread, and the doc comments on `Committer`, on `Client` and `TextCursor` in `FocusedClient.swift`, and on `committer` and `insertions` in `main.swift` make a measured case for doing so. That case was measured while the controller still received key-downs. It no longer decides where client calls run; rule 4 does. What following the rule costs is measured again on `low-imk-rules-w3g.3ky`.
