/// not arrived yet. Quiet longer than that is let go as it arrives, however long it runs,
/// before the first speech and between speech alike: Whisper reads words into silence it
/// is handed ("Thank you."), so an utterance that opens on minutes of it, as a Realtime
/// item does between a client's turns, or holds minutes of it after a click, would
/// otherwise carry words nobody said (low-serve-axq.ium). What was let go is kept as a
/// `Timeline`, which times the words a pass reads in the audio appended. Trailing
/// quiet is never worth a pass, during the hold or after it: a pass over the same
/// speech and more silence reads the same words, and the encoder's cost does not
/// shrink with the tail. So the pass in flight when the key comes up is the last
/// one whenever the speaker stopped before releasing, and a hold with nothing said
/// in it costs no decode at all.
