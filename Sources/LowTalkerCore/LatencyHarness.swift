/// Times an engine the way the app pays for it: one load, then every fixture held
/// and heard. A hold is simulated in real time: each chunk of the clip reaches the
/// engine when its audio would have been captured, the key comes up with the last
/// chunk, and the clock runs from there until the transcript is back. Delivered
/// as a batch, the whole clip is one chunk that arrives at key-up, so the engine
/// starts from nothing; streamed, it arrives a microphone buffer at a time, so the
/// engine hears during the hold and key-up finalizes the tail. Each fixture is
/// held once and then `reruns` more times, so a median shrugs off a stray pause
/// while the first hold stays apart: after warm-load at launch, the first
/// dictation of a session pays it. Every hold tells the engine the same
/// vocabulary, so a run measures what a mode's vocabulary does to hearing, on
/// the fixtures that say its terms and on the ones that do not. Every hold also
/// holds the engine as the app's presses do, and while `Serving.served` other callers
