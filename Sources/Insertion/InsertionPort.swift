/// The input method's end of the channel: the named port the app sends to.
///
/// [LAW:effects-at-boundaries] Hosting the port, checking who sent each request and
/// decoding its bytes is all this does. What to do with the text is the closure's, and the
/// closure is where the text input system lives - so the half that knows about macOS
/// clients knows nothing about ports, and this half knows nothing about clients.
///
/// **Only this installation's app is answered.** The name is derived from the public bundle
/// identifier, so any process running as the person can compute it, and a request answered
/// without asking who sent it is text typed into the front window for anyone, with no grant
/// at all. So every request is checked against `senders` before its bytes are read, and one
/// that fails is answered `senderIsNotThisInstallationsApp` and told to `turnedAway` - the
/// insert closure never sees it. [LAW:single-enforcer]
///
/// Both closures run on `queue`, one request at a time, and the answer is sent when the
/// closure returns. Whatever the closure touches that lives elsewhere, it reaches itself:
/// the input method hosts this on a queue of its own and asks the main actor only which
/// cursor is in front, so a slow answer never holds the keys the main thread handles.
/// [LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling]
///
/// Held for the life of the process by whoever makes it. Released, the port closes and the
/// app's next request finds nothing listening; a request already being answered finishes
/// first, because the port is only taken down once the queue is out of it.
